This program allows you to enter a student's credit hours, 
as well as their designated county. Counties include Beaufort, Hampton, Jasper, Polaris, as well as "Homeschool", "Private", or "Other." 

There is also a radio button that can be selected to identify a student as "out of state."

> submitting "Beaufort" will enable you to enter the student's tuition total in order to check to see if it adheres to a specific price per credit hour requirement.
